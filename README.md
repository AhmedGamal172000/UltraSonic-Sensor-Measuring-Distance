# UltraSonic-Sensor-Measuring-Distance

Used ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.

Measuring the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. Check the “HC-SR04 Ultrasonic MT Student Tutorial” pdf file to understand how to interface with this sensor.

The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture model as follow by their order:
Application Layer
LCD AND ULTRASONIC Layer
DIO AND ICU Layer

by using call-back function to prevent losing our layered architecture.
